# Tracking Automated Employment Decision Tool Bias Audits

Many employers commonly use automated or AI-based tools as part of their [hiring processes](https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/know-your-digital-rights-digital-discrimination-in-hiring), including to advertise job opportunities, collect and filter applications, review resumes, conduct interviews, and more. These tools can enable or exacerbate discrimination in hiring based on race, sex, disability, or other protected characteristics, and applicants may not even know they are being used in the first place. 

Because of a [recently enacted law](https://www.nyc.gov/site/dca/about/automated-employment-decision-tools.page), employers in New York City using these technologies are now required to work with independent auditors to conduct “bias audits” of some of the tools they use and share certain results publicly. While employers are required to provide a link to relevant bias audits on their website, these audits can be very difficult to find, and some employers have posted and later removed this information. We think that for algorithmic audits to provide meaningful transparency, they should be easily accessible. That's why the ACLU and NYCLU created this repository, where you can find examples of bias audits employers have posted publicly, as well as links to [Perma.cc](https://perma.cc/) captures of employers' bias audits. 

If you know of Local Law 144 bias audits that employers have posted that we missed, you can [email us](mailto:analytics_inquiry@aclu.org) to let us know.
